# Order Management Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **Order Management Data Warehouse Project** repository!
---
In this project, i designed and developed a data warehouse and analytics solution, utilising medallion architecture best practices to transform raw data from two sources into business-ready data for analytics and reporting purposes.

This project is developed as a portfolio project to highlight industry best practices in data engineering, data modelling and analytics.

---
**The raw data came from two different sources**:

* ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning): contains sales orders, product information, store data, and shipment details.
* POS (Point of sales): contains sales transactions, product and store details, customer information, and shipment data.

# Project Overview
This project covers the full data lifecycle:
1. Data Architecture: Designing a modern Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
2. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from POS and ERP source systems into the warehouse
3. Data Modelling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimised for analytical queries and reporting.
4. Analytical & Reporting creating SQL-based reports using Views and dashboards to deliver actionable insights for stakeholders.

## ðŸ“Š Data Architecture  
The warehouse follows a Medallion Architecture:
* **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested from ERP and POS systems
* **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and standardised data ready for analysis.
* **Gold Layer**: Analytical aggregates, business-ready queries, and KPIs views for business users.
